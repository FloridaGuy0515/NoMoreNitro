# NoMoreNitro
A BetterDiscord theme that removes references to, or advertisements for Discord Nitro or Server Boosting.

## Introduction
I got tired of Discord pestering me to subscribe to Nitro, so I made this BetterDiscord theme to remove anything to do with Nitro or Server Boosting (with some exceptions.)

**DO NOT USE IF YOU ARE SUBSCRIBED TO DISCORD NITRO.** This will likely cause features you are paying for to become unusable. This theme is for people who do not have and do not want Discord Nitro, and want to remove all references and advertisements for it across the client.

## Exceptions
I have left certain things alone as they may provide useful information or functionality.

For example, in `Server Settings/Overview`, I have left the toggle switches for *"Send a message when someone boosts this server"* and *"Show Boost progress bar"* alone, as they provide functionality to server admins. Also, in `User Settings/Keybinds`, I have left *"Toggle sticker picker"* visible, as it provides potentially useful information, despite the fact stickers are unavailable to non-subscribers.

If you do not want these visible, the style settings are already in the file. It's just a matter of you going in and uncommenting them.

(I may end up changing some of these later.)

## "You missed something, and there's not a style setting for it in the file."
If you find something I missed, feel free to open an issue and I'll try to fix it.
